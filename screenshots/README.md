# Screenshots

This folder contains screenshots for the README documentation.

## Required Screenshots

1. **homepage.png** - Main page with mood selection cards
2. **recommendations.png** - Album recommendations display
3. **playlist.png** - Playlist creation interface

## How to Capture Screenshots

1. Run the application locally
2. Connect with Spotify
3. Use your browser's screenshot tool or:
   - Windows: Win + Shift + S
   - Mac: Cmd + Shift + 4
   - Linux: PrtScn or use GNOME Screenshot

## Screenshot Guidelines

- **Resolution**: At least 1920x1080
- **Format**: PNG for quality
- **Browser**: Chrome or Firefox for consistency
- **Window**: Full browser window showing the interface
- **Content**: Show actual data (your albums/playlists)

## Placeholder Images

Until you add real screenshots, the README references these files as placeholders. You can:
1. Take screenshots and add them here
2. Use placeholder services like https://placehold.co/
3. Leave as-is with broken image links (they won't break the README)

**Tip**: After adding screenshots, verify they display correctly in the README!
